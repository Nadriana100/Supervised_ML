SUMMARY 

Summary, 

Scale data had an impact when we use the Random Forest having better results. 

Logistic Regression had pretty similar results scaling or not the data. 


A Random Forest Classifier.

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to 
improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), 
otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.


Logistic Regression Classifier.

In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘ovr’, and uses the cross-entropy 
loss if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘multinomial’.
